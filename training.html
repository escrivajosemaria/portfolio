		<h4>A Space for Learning, Exchange, and Professional Growth</h4>

		<p>
			The Collective brings together young community health professionals, students,
			early-career practitioners, and experienced health workers through scheduled
			sessions that focus on both technical and career-oriented topics. Participants
			can book and join live sessions held on specific dates, where invited health
			specialists share insights drawn from practice, research, policy, and innovation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Session themes vary widely and intentionally reflect the breadth of the health
			sector. Topics include career pathways in public health and clinical practice,
			emerging and re-emerging diseases, advances in digital health and health technology,
			mental health, health systems leadership, research skills, and navigating work
			in complex health environments. This diversity reflects the understanding that
			health careers are not linear and that exposure to multiple perspectives strengthens
			professional judgment and adaptability.
		</p>

		<p>
			The approach is deliberately interactive rather than lecture-driven. Sessions
			encourage dialogue, questions, and reflection, allowing participants to engage
			directly with speakers and with each other. Learning is treated as a shared process,
			where lived experience, field realities, and evidence inform discussion. This model
			aligns with adult learning research, which emphasizes peer exchange and relevance
			as key drivers of meaningful learning and professional development

			</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Beyond individual sessions, Escriva Health Collective is intended to grow into
			a community of practice. By connecting participants across disciplines and career
			stages, the initiative supports ongoing learning, collaboration, and the exchange
			of opportunities. Global health literature increasingly recognizes communities of
			practice as effective mechanisms for strengthening workforce capacity and sustaining
			knowledge beyond formal training settings

			<h3>Training Frontline Health Workers: Turning Guidelines into Practice</h3>
			<p>
				Training frontline health workers often reveals the gap between policy guidance and operational reality. Sessions with nurses, community health workers, and facility staff focused on translating national guidelines into practical actions that could be implemented within resource-constrained settings. Topics included service delivery standards, infection prevention, documentation, and basic data use for decision-making.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rather than relying on lecture-based methods, training emphasized case discussions, scenario-based problem solving, and peer reflection. This approach reflects evidence from adult learning research, which shows that experiential learning significantly improves retention and application of knowledge in health settings
				<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-HIS-HWF-2016.1" target="_blank" style="color:#8fd3c8;">World Health Organization</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="data-note">
				Typical facility-based trainings engaged 20–30 health workers per session, often supported by follow-up supervision to reinforce learning.

			<h3>Community-Level Training: Building Knowledge Where Services Meet People</h3>
			<p>
				Community training sessions focused on strengthening health literacy, disease prevention, and service utilization among community members and local volunteers. Topics included vaccination awareness, malaria prevention, non-communicable disease risk factors, and early care-seeking behaviors. These sessions were designed to be participatory, using dialogue, demonstrations, and locally relevant examples.
			</p>
			<p>
				Community capacity building plays a critical role in improving health outcomes, particularly in underserved settings. Evidence shows that informed and engaged communities are more likely to use preventive services and hold health systems accountable
				<a href="https://www.unicef.org/health/community-health" target="_blank" style="color:#8fd3c8;">UNICEF</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="data-note">
				Community trainings typically reached 40–70 participants per session, often facilitated in collaboration with local leaders and health volunteers.

	<div class="training-block">
		<div class="training-text">
			<h3>Leadership and Program Management Training</h3>
			<p>
				Capacity building extended beyond frontline service delivery to include supervisors, program managers, and coordinators. These sessions focused on leadership, planning, monitoring and evaluation, and the use of data for adaptive management. Emphasis was placed on understanding roles, mandates, and accountability structures within health systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Strengthening leadership and management capacity is widely recognized as a key determinant of health system performance. Studies by the World Bank highlight that capable managers significantly improve service efficiency and program sustainability
				<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/publication/health-systems-governance" target="_blank" style="color:#8fd3c8;">World Bank</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="data-note">
				Management-focused trainings often involved smaller cohorts of 15–25 participants to allow deeper discussion and applied planning exercises.

		<div class="training-text">
			<h3>What These Trainings Reinforced</h3>
			<p>
				Across facilities, communities, and leadership spaces, training consistently reinforced one lesson: capacity building is not about delivering information, but about enabling confidence, judgment, and problem-solving within real constraints. Sustainable impact emerges when people understand not just what to do, but why it matters and how to adapt it to their context.
			</p>
			<p>
				These experiences continue to shape how training is designed and delivered, emphasizing relevance, participation, and follow-up rather than one-off events. This reflects a growing consensus in global health that learning systems, not isolated trainings, are what ultimately strengthen health systems.
